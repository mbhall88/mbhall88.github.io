// deeper inputs leave.
//
// It was then swept against the paper's whole benchmark and left here, because the benchmark says
// the choice sits on a plateau: normalizing at all is what moves the error, and where the
// threshold sits inside the plateau does not. What it does control is how much of the benchmark is
// disturbed to fix the few runs that need it, and raising it would give up the borderline runs

// rather than three, which reads like noise and is not. Six skewed inputs whose genome size is
// known were subsampled until their median depth fell through three, two and one; normalizing was
// nearer the truth on all 46 inputs that produced, a floor at a median depth of three would have
// refused 27 of them, and the estimates are in
// `paper/corrections/issue56_low_depth_normalization.tsv`. What survives that far down is the
// ratio: the high-copy sequence that makes an input skewed is counted hundreds of times over where
// the rest of the genome is counted once, and the ratio is all this rule reads.
//
// The benchmark sweep pulls the other way on this, and it is worth saying why it did not win.
// Raising the multiplier to four halves the already-correct benchmark runs that normalization
// pushes out of the band, and costs no rescues. But a larger multiplier buys that by normalizing
// less, and where normalizing less is expensive is exactly where the benchmark is thinnest: it
// holds three skewed runs with a profile median depth under four. So #56's ladder was rebuilt
// across the same six multipliers, and over the runs down at a median depth of three or less the
// estimate falls away monotonically as the multiplier rises. The multiplier trades
// under-correcting the shallow against over-correcting the deep, and the shallow side is both
// better sampled and worse harmed. The runs are in
// `paper/corrections/issue36_low_depth_multiplier.tsv` and the argument is in
